# SEC EDGAR Text
Download company filings from the SEC EDGAR service, and find key text
sections of interest.

#### About the project

* I used [SEC-Edgar-Crawler](https://github.com/rahulrrixe/sec-edgar)
for initial ideas which helped this project.
* Thanks to my colleagues at Rosenberg Equities for help with an earlier
attempt to download EDGAR data.

## Installation


## Usage
Typical usage (default: download the 500 companies in 'companies_list.txt'):

```python secedgartext --storage=/tmp/storage_folder```

### Other packages
Many specialised projects automate access to EDGAR filings.
Some focus on downloading whole filing documents, financial statements
information, or parsing XBRL filings. This package specialises in
accessing text data only.
